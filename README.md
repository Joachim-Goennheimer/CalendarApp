# CalendarApp

Most of the App is self-explanatory but in the following we will give some additional information.

Events:

New Events can either be created by clicking on the Create New Entry button or by clicking on the cell that corresponds to the event time.

Categories:

Categories can be selected and deselected. An event will only be displayed if it has either no category or if at least one of its categories is selected.
When deleting a category, the category will also be removed from all events that were attributed to the category.

Still to be implemented:

Events that go over several months-years are not displayed correctly. Due to lack of time we could not implement the functionality until
the submission date.
